#### A Compendium of Clean Graphs in R (Version 2.0) Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and Quentin F. Gronau
##### This compendium facilitates the creation of good graphs by presenting a set of concrete examples, ranging from the trivial to the advanced. The graphs can all be reproduced and adjusted by copy-pasting code into the R console. A note for R fans: the majority of our plots have been created in base R, but you will encounter some examples in ggplot.
